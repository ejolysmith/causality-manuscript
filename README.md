# Exploiting fluctuations in gene expression to detect causal interactions between genes
Data and analysis code for eLife manuscript "Exploiting fluctuations in gene expression to detect causal interactions between genes".

This repository is organized as follows:

1. Purged single-cell fluorescence trajectories are stored in data directory. Code for analysing these trajectories to correct for drift and non-even illumination, and to obtain normalized covariances, are also in this directory. 
2. Python code for generating figures are in the respective fig directories. Outputs were further analyzed with Inkscape to adjust colours, fonts, and formats.
3. Simulation code and data are in the simulation directory.
4. Adjusted DelTA segmentation pipeline scripts along with trained models are in delta-segmentation directory.
5. Plasmid details with sequencing are in plasmid-sequences directory.
